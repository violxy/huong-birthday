  	<p>Hi Huong, I hope you like your demise. ^^</p>

<p>-er, I mean, happy birthday Huong. ^^ Cause like, you're so awesome we have to beat it into you that it's your birthday. Cause like, why not, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy all the pictures of hot guys and derpy cats. I personally proposed we give you derpy guys and hot cats, but that got vetoed somewhere...</p>

<p>But in all seriousness, thanks for being an awesome friend for the last year, and hope this next year just keeps getting better ^^</p>

<p>(Especially with Elividerp ^^)</p>
