  	<p>Happy 21st, Huong! It's been really great getting to know you, and I'm glad that we're sharing an apartment. You're funny sometimes, and other times just hilarious, so keep that up and stay awesome. :D</p>
    <p>Have confidence in your abilities - I have confidence in you, and know that you're going to go places. (but for goodness' sake, start some things earlier, woman)</p>
    <p>Here's to a wonderful remaining half of Mudd and a great year ahead!</p>
    <p>And no, we're not getting a cat.</p>
    <p>p.s. Hope you liked the site.</p>
